# Security Automation

This repository includes automated security vulnerability detection and resolution workflows to ensure dependencies are kept up-to-date and secure.

## Components

### 1. Dependabot Configuration (`.github/dependabot.yml`)

Automatically scans for outdated dependencies across multiple package ecosystems:
- **Maven dependencies** in the main project
- **Maven dependencies** in the spotless-maven-plugin module  
- **Python dependencies** in the graphrag module

Configuration features:
- Daily security scans
- Automatic PR creation for security updates
- Proper labeling for easy identification
- Targeted branch management

### 2. Security Auto-Upgrade Workflow (`.github/workflows/security-auto-upgrade.yml`)

A comprehensive GitHub Action that:

#### Security Scanning
- Runs OWASP Dependency Check to identify vulnerabilities
- Generates detailed security reports
- Uploads scan results as artifacts

#### Automated Dependency Updates
- Updates Maven dependencies to latest secure versions
- Updates Maven plugins to latest versions
- Verifies builds pass after updates
- Only allows minor/patch updates to avoid breaking changes

#### Auto-Merge for Dependabot PRs
- Automatically approves and merges dependabot security PRs
- Runs build and tests before merging
- Provides detailed feedback on merge status

#### Triggers
- **Pull Requests**: Runs on dependabot PRs with security labels
- **Scheduled**: Daily at 6 AM UTC for proactive scanning
- **Manual**: On-demand via workflow_dispatch

### 3. OWASP Dependency Check Integration

Added to the main `pom.xml`:
- **Plugin Version**: 9.0.7 (latest)
- **CVSS Threshold**: 7 (fails build on high/critical vulnerabilities)
- **Suppression File**: `dependency-check-suppressions.xml` for false positive management
- **Output Formats**: HTML and JSON for comprehensive reporting
- **NVD API Key**: Configured to use `NVD_API_KEY` environment variable for authenticated NVD access

**Important**: Since May 2023, the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) requires an API key for automated data downloads. Without an API key, dependency checks will fail with 403 Forbidden errors. The repository must have the `NVD_API_KEY` secret configured in GitHub Actions settings.

### 4. Maven Versions Plugin

Integrated for dependency management:
- **Plugin Version**: 2.16.2 (latest)
- **Backup POM Generation**: Disabled for cleaner workflow
- Enables automated dependency version updates

## Usage

### Viewing Security Reports

1. Security scan results are uploaded as artifacts in each workflow run
2. Access via GitHub Actions → Security Auto-Upgrade → Artifacts
3. Download and view HTML reports for detailed vulnerability information

### Manual Security Updates

Trigger manual security updates using GitHub's workflow dispatch:

```bash
# Navigate to Actions tab in GitHub
# Select "Security Auto-Upgrade" workflow  
# Click "Run workflow"
# Optionally enable "Force upgrade all dependencies"
```

### Suppressing False Positives

Edit `dependency-check-suppressions.xml` to suppress false positive vulnerabilities:

```xml
<suppress>
    <notes><![CDATA[Reason for suppression]]></notes>
    <packageUrl regex="true">^pkg:maven/groupId/artifactId@.*$</packageUrl>
    <cve>CVE-YYYY-NNNNN</cve>
</suppress>
```

### Local Security Scanning

Run security scans locally using Maven:

```bash
# Run OWASP dependency check (requires NVD_API_KEY environment variable)
export NVD_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
mvn org.owasp:dependency-check-maven:check

# Check for outdated dependencies
mvn versions:display-dependency-updates
mvn versions:display-plugin-updates

# Update dependencies (use with caution)
mvn versions:use-latest-versions
```

**Note**: To obtain an NVD API key, register at https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key

## Security Best Practices

1. **Review Auto-Merge Results**: While the workflow auto-merges dependabot PRs, always review the changes
2. **Monitor Security Reports**: Regularly check security scan artifacts for new vulnerabilities
3. **Update Suppressions**: Periodically review and update the suppressions file
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Even automated updates should be followed by thorough testing
5. **Stay Informed**: Subscribe to security advisories for your dependencies

## Workflow Permissions

The security workflow requires these permissions:
- `contents: write` - To create branches and commits
- `pull-requests: write` - To create and merge PRs
- `security-events: write` - To upload security scan results
- `checks: write` - To approve PRs

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures After Updates

If the build fails after dependency updates:
1. Check the workflow logs for specific error messages
2. Review the changes in the auto-generated PR
3. Look for breaking changes in dependency changelogs
4. Consider suppressing specific updates if they cause issues

### False Positive Vulnerabilities

If OWASP Dependency Check reports false positives:
1. Research the specific CVE to confirm it's a false positive
2. Add appropriate suppressions to `dependency-check-suppressions.xml`
3. Document the reason for suppression
4. Set expiration dates for periodic review

### Workflow Execution Issues

If the workflow fails to run:
1. Check repository permissions and secrets
2. Verify the workflow file syntax
3. Review GitHub Actions limits and quotas
4. Check dependabot configuration syntax

### NVD API Key Issues

If OWASP Dependency Check fails with 403 errors:
1. Ensure the `NVD_API_KEY` secret is configured in GitHub repository settings
2. Register for an API key at https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key if needed
3. Verify the API key has sufficient quota and is not expired
4. Check that the environment variable is properly injected in workflow steps

## Integration with Existing Workflows

This security automation integrates with existing workflows:
- Runs alongside the existing Maven CI/CD pipeline
- Respects existing formatting rules (Spotless)
- Works with the existing dependency graph submission
- Maintains compatibility with existing build processes
